Overview
========

What is this program?
---------------------

The goal of HTTP-log is to monitor an actively writen HTTP access log, typically on a LAMP server.

You can find a description of what I had to do here: :ref:`subject`

101 User Manual
---------------

You can use the ``httplog`` command in a terminal opened in the ``source`` folder.
Type ``httplog -h`` to see the help.

* **If you do have** a HTTP access file being writen on your server, type ``httplog path`` (where ``path`` is its relative path to httplog or absolute path) to start to monitor it.

* **If you don't have** a HTTP access file being writen right now, type ``httplog path -s`` to start a simulation.
  ``path`` should be the path to a *simulation config file*, you can find two of them in the ``data`` folder:
  ``sim_config`` and ``short_config``. ``sim_config`` gently explains you what it contains.

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

The ``path`` argument is mandatory.
Use ``-l`` to set the log level, and ``-s`` to indicate that you do a simulation, if you do.

See the ``--help`` for more information.

What are all those folders for?
-------------------------------

There should be several folders in your ``HTTP-log`` folder. Let's have a quick look:

* ``source``: obviously where the source code is. Go there to play with the program.
* ``data``: used to store some useful test or configuration files.
* ``log``: the place where you will find the files generated by the program.
* ``documentation`` is where you are now, it contains all the documentation web and config files (for sphinx).

And now what?
-------------

You could read my page about :ref:`architecture` to understand it!
