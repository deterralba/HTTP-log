**Dear reader,**

This is the cherish documentation of my ``httplog`` program.
I hope you will like it, I tried to make it as smooth as possible.

Let's go to the point!
----------------------

If you are in a hurry, you just need:

1. to have a python 2.7 installed,
2. to go to the ``/source`` folder in your favorite terminal and type ``httplog ../data/sim_config -s``
3. ???
4. **Profit!**

Explanations: This launches a *simulation* of the program: a log file (``log/simulated_log``) is actively written
by a special part of the program and read in the meantime read by the usual program.
You will see every 10s a summery of the traffic observed, with alerts when it's
going up, and down, and up, and...


There should be several folder in your ``HTTP-log`` folder. Let's have a quick look:

* ``source`` is obviously were there is the source code. Go there to play with the program.
* ``data`` is used to store some useful test or configuration files.
* ``log`` is the place where you will find the files generated by the program.
* ``documentation`` is where you are now, it contains all the documentation web and config files (for sphinx).
